# SMoneyTracker

This web application is created to keep track of daily expenses, budget based on a monthly salary and how much is available within each category, bank accounts and savings.

This project was created in order to put on practice the knowledge acquired within the udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-and-nodejs-the-practical-guide/

The features implemented with their corresponding screen shots are located in: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2235846 within the done section

## Notes

The missing tests are coming in the near future after I learn how to work with Protractor, please stay tuned!

## Run the application
